# PS-palindrome-search exercise

## Instructions

- Using vanilla javascript, create a function that finds the second longest palindrome in a the string

- Output of the function should be as follows
  - when no palindrome exists => 'No Palindrome exists'
  - When there is only one palindrome => 'No Second Palindrome exists'
  - When there is a second palindrome => 'Found Palindrome: [PALINDROME]'
- After you complete the exercise, provide any notes on your code below such as how to run your example
